# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Sep 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Created app, finished the app logic

**Thoughts:** I started this challenge with the 'Front End Development Libraries Projects' from free-code-camp website (check out the **links to work**). I really struggled with CSS, but i managed to almost finish the whole thing. There is only one small detail that I need to work which requires more "CSS stuffs".

**Link to work:** [Build a Random Quote Machine](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine)

### Day 2: Sep 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished first project

**Thoughts:** Today I finished the Random quote machine project. It was a good start, but like I said yesterday the CSS part was a struggle.
