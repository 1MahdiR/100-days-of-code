# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Sep 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Created app, finished the app logic

**Thoughts:** I started this challenge with the 'Front End Development Libraries Projects' from free-code-camp website (check out the **links to work**). I really struggled with CSS, but i managed to almost finish the whole thing. There is only one small detail that I need to work which requires more "CSS stuffs".

**Link to work:** [Build a Random Quote Machine](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine)
